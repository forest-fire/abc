# Examples


All example code can be found in the repos under `/examples` and can be booted up as a VueJS application to try out.

> Note: VueJS is just the author's favorite flavor at the moment; the examples -- outside of Vuex (which is tied to Vue's reactivity system) -- are fully usable with any SPA or just plain old JS.
