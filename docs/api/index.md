# Overview

The API's provided by ABC are as follows:

1. **Core API**

   The core API which App users will use to interact with state.

2. **StoreConnect API**
   
   Used by state management plugins to bridge into the ABC ecosystem.

3. **DbConnect API** -  _` future `_

   Used to connect local databases into ABC; currently IndexedDB is assumed but
   we will want to open up other options so that non-browser clients can also
   leverage ABC.
